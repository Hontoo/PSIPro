Pattern Timing Tuning by Malcolm MacKenzie

Thanks to Malcolm (Maxstang) for the boards, support, testing and encouragement.

## Version History

    * Version 0.99_2 - 9th April 2020
        * Fixed the Command line setting for per pattern timeout that was added yesterday
            * Timings over 32 seconds did not work
            * To set the pattern as "always On" Set the timing parameter to 256 which will
            * run the pattern for 16 hours - I'll call that good enough for always on!
         *  Added Firmware Average for the POT readings.  This works around the issue of not 
             having a resitor on the POT.

    *  Version 0.98 - 8th April 2020
       *  Added the ability for each sequence to run for a given time.
           * Rather than try to set the time a pattern runs for by setting the loops, you can
           * specify the total time the pattern should run for.  To disable the total run time
           * and use a set number of loops, set the run time parameter to 0.
       *  Added the ability to set the command duration in seconds via the command.
           * This only applies to T commands.  
           * Send the command using 0Tx|y where |y is optional.  y is in seconds.

    *  Version 0.97 - 7th April 2020
        *  Added ability to set Disco Ball and VU Meter on Indefinately.
            * Mode 13 is the new Always on Disco Ball
            * Mode 12 is the timed Disco Ball 
            * Mode 92 is VU Meter (always on) to match Logic commanding
            * Mode 21 is VU Meter timed
        *  Restored the fast switch between USB Serial and Tx/Rx Pin Serial

    *  Version 0.96 - 5th April 2020
        *  Added address checking for T commands
        *  0 is all
        *  4 is Front PSI
        *  5 is rear PSI as taken from Marc's Teeces command guide.

        * Address field is interpreted as follows:
            * 0 - global address, all displays that support the command are set
            * 1 - TFLD (Top Front Logic Dislay)
            * 2 - BFLD (Bottom Front Logic Display)
            * 3 - RLD  (Rear Logic Display)
            * 4 - Front PSI
            * 5 - Rear PSI
            * 6 - Front Holo (not implemented here)
            * 7 - Rear Holo  (not implemented here)
            * 8 - Top Holo   (not implemented here)

    *  Version 0.9.5 - 5th April 2020
        *  Star Wars scrolling text sequence added
        *  Minor bug fixes

    *  Version 0.94 - 4th April 2020
        *  Comments cleanup and clarification
        *  More timing tweaks
        *  Work around added for serial difficulties with non Sparkfun Pro Micro

    *  Version 0.93 - 1st April 2020 (Happy April Fools Day!)
        *  Code cleanup, and code size reduction
        *  Timing tweaks from Malcolm for various sequences.
        *  Updated JawaLite To support A, D and P (P used to change always on mode)
        *  T1 (Swipe) is now the default sequence, as MarcDuino sends 0T1 on startup.
        *  Added the ability to set the default pattern in the config.h  
        *      Note that MarcDuino will send 0T1, so whatever is in Mode 1 will be the starting pattern.
        *      After that point when a sequence completes, it will restore the "defaultPattern" 
        *      as defined in config.h
        *  EEPROM Support added to store various global settings:
        *      alwaysOn config
        *      Internal or External POT use
        *      Internal brightness setting if using Internal Brightness value (1P1 was sent)
        *  Fixed a bug in the VU Meter Sequence.

    *  Version 0.8 - 31st March 2020
        *  Added Lightsaber Battle animation
        *  Added Pulse for rear logic dsiplay on T9
        *  Updated JawaLite Commanding on Serial to be 0Txx format
        *  Added the ability to change the serial port by defining USB_DEBUG.  
        *    Uncomment #define USB_DEBUG for serial comunications using Tx and Rx (removed again)
        *  Set the default behavior for unrecognised commands to just keep running the swipe pattern.
        *  Configuration data moved to config.h rather than being scattered.

    *  Version 0.7 - 30th March 2020
        *  Non-Delay version of code.
        *  Allows sequences to be interrupted at ay time.
        *  Waiting for sequence completion is no longer required
        *  Set the defauly brightness in setup from the Brightness POT

    *  Version 0.6 - 29th March 2020
        *  Base versions of most sequences implented
        *  Support for Front/Rear color selection using Jumper implemented
        *  Brightness Pot implemented
